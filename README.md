# JKirchartz Resume Generator

After a recent redesign of my own resume proved difficult to maintain (using InDesign.)
I decided to Generate a PDF resume from markdown with pandoc, after stumbling upon [Ixxie's CV][1].

To build the resume run `make` and a new PDF will be generated in the current folder.

## Colophon

* [Montserrat][5]
* [Font Awesome][6]


## Special Thanks

[Ixxie][2] for the [inspiration][1], [Sway][3] for the original [Latex/FontAwesome code][4]
